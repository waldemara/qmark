qmark
=====

Simple cpu benchmark. Defaults are tuned to produce qmark of about 500 on a six core 2.2 GHz Xeon.

To build a statically linked binary:

		git clone https://github.com/waldemara/qmark.git
		cd qmark
		export CGO_ENABLED=0
		go generate
		go build

To run with default parameters:

		./qmark

Go improves performance of its compiler with every release. It's best to compare qmarks generated by a binary with the same build id.
